    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nData Sources\nAppeals data was kindly provided to the Urban Research Group by the Fulton County Tax Assessor’s Office. For other parcel characteristics, Tax Parcel data (2022) was downloaded from the publicly available Fulton County GIS Portal2. Fulton County cities boundaries were aquired from the ARC Open Data and Mapping Hub3.\n\n\nProcedure\nAppeals data was outer joined to tax parcel data on Parcel ID. The resulting dataframe contains all appeals from 2011 to 2022 with their associated parcel data, and parcels that had no appeals over the period. After confirming both the tax parcel and city boundary dataset had an identical coordinate reference system (CRS), the dataframe was spatially (predicate: within) joined the city boundaries. Each parcel now had a column corresponding to its city name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note a minor limitation of this approach. Since tax parcel data is limited only to 2022 but appeals start in 2011, some parcels may have changed throughout the study period. 6.3K parcels could not be matched to the 2022 data, resulting in 273K valid parcels. I believe this limitation is negligable. Our main focus is repeat appealers and a parcel which has changed throughout the period cannot be accurately included.\n\n\nTables were generated with key measures at each level, one that aggreggated appeals at the city level, another at the parcel level, and another by year. While I outline some key decisions here, I encourage viewing the source code for the complete implementation.\nNotably, an appeal is successful if the difference between Notice Assessment and Current Assessment was positive. Notice Assessment is the original tax bill assessment, whereas Current Assessment is the result after a possible adjustment. Therefore, appeals are successful when the tax bill assessment is reduced. The calculated difference in assessment is adjusted for inflation. However, this undercounts the total impact of the appeals process on tax revenue, as detailed in the discussion section.\nOnly successful appeals are considered when calculating the mean and median percent change in assessment. Including all appeals would skew reduce the result towards zero. This calculation may be worth revisitng to understand the mean reduction on a per-parcel level.\nFinally, lost revenue is the sum of tax bill reductions multiplied by 0.00432. Georgia calculates a tax bill by multiplying the property’s assessed value by 40% and then multiplying the resulting value by the millage rate 4. The number I derived is a lower bound estimate of millage rates throughout Fulton County, multiplied by 0.4. Still, this calculation undercounts even further than the lower bound, as discussed in the following section."

Such a metric provides insight into cities that account for more appeals than expected.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nSource: Generate Vis for Fulton County Appeal Filings\n\nTaken in context that southern Fulton tends to have lower property values than northern Fulton, this map provides useful insights. There are a relatively high number of parcels in southern Fulton county that file up to five repeat appeals. After five appeals, the distribution begins to shift significantly to Atlanta, Sandy Springs (Buckhead), and northern Fulton, with few parcels in southern Fulton filing repeat appeals beyond this threshold. Such a pattern appears to indicate that more unique parcels in southern Fulton have filed repeat appeals overall, but northern Fulton has a higher share of serial filers. Between five to six appeals appears to be the threshold.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nSource: Generate Vis for Fulton County Appeal Filings\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nSource: Generate Vis for Fulton County Appeal Filings\n\nNo major differences in appeal success rate exists between cities. Sandy Springs, Chattahoochee Hills, Fairburn, and Alpharetta are slightly more successful than average. Mountain Park is an outlier but has a small sample size. Chattahoochee Hills and Fairburn also have few parcels compared to Sandy Springs and Alpharetta. However, no significance test was run for this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nSource: Generate Vis for Fulton County Appeal Filings\n\nThe sum of tax bill reductions is heavily dependent on the mean property values of each city. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of tax bill reductions come from Atlanta, lagged by Sandy Springs. These cities also have a large portion of high value commercial and office space.\n\n\nDiscussion\nMost tax bill reductions in Fulton County come from Atlanta and Sandy Springs (Buckhead). Occasional repeat appealers (5 or less appeals over 12 years) tend to concentrate in southern Fulton where property values are generally low; serial repeat appealers are heavily concentrated in northern Fulton where property values are generally high.\nThis analysis is not exhaustive and no statistical tests were run. Calculating reductions in tax bills using only Notice and Current Assessments undercounts 1) appreciation that would accrue if the assessment was not frozen by the appeal, and 2) any instances of under appraisal both proceeding the appeal and following it. There have been numerous accounts of systemic under appraisal, especially for high value properties. Such practices are largely codified into the apprasial process. This topic should be investigated further."
